To record the work, a special device was built that's attached to a tall industrial crane, which contains a stack of wooden picture frames that can be released from a height of ten to fifteen meters. The camera is placed right in the center of the action and captures the frames' movement while they fall down. The slow motion recording of 240 still frames per second allows us to experience every millimeter of movement to the very detail. While the frames get smaller and smaller in perspective as they move further away from our view, they are immediately followed by the next frame and the next one, until they've all reached the floor and found a place to rest.",

When a young man dreams that he drowns after a night of carnal passion, he asks a buddhist monk to translate the experience for him. The monk replies that the dream is a warning not to indulge the pleasures of the flesh to excess, but the man ignores his advice, marrying a virgin and making love to her constantly. However, after several torrid affairs, the man begins to realise the sagacity of the monk's warning.",

    "description": "Another gruesome case involving a woman who's a sole survivor of a brutal massacre. A local constable questions the woman about her whereabouts and what might have happened the night before. As he gets the young woman to talk, she spins a tale of debauchery, madness and people so vile that you wished that they'll never see daylight again. Why is this woman so reluctant to talk? Who else might be involved in this ghastly murder? How will this bumbling cop get any solid leads or useful clues from this shell shocked woman?",

She is just considering in the job she's offered Mandy, which is .... to frequently check with the neighborhood brothelkeeper, and find away if she's found guys with incredibly difficult manhoods.
